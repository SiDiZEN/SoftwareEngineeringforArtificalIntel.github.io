There is growing interest today in incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) components into software systems. This interest results from the increasing availability of frameworks and tools for developing ML components, as well as their promise to improve solutions to data-driven decision problems. In industry and DoD alike, putting systems that include ML components into production can be challenging. Developing an ML system is more than just building an ML model: The model must be tested for production readiness, integrated into larger systems, monitored at run time, and then evolved as data changes and redeployed. Because of this complexity, software engineering for machine learning (SE4ML) is emerging as a field of interest. <br>

An ML-enabled system is a software system that relies on one or more ML components to provide capabilities. ML-enabled systems must be engineered such that

Integration of ML components is straightforward.
The system is instrumented for runtime monitoring of ML components and production data.
The cycle of training and retraining these systems is accelerated.
Many existing software engineering practices apply directly to these requirements, but these practices typically are not used in data science, the field of study that focuses on development of ML algorithms and models that are incorporated into software systems. Other software engineering practices will require adaptation or extension to deal with ML components. <br>

LIMITATIONS</h2>
<p>
Our case study was conducted with teams at Microsoft, a
large, world-wide software company with a diverse portfolio
of software products. It is also one of the largest purveyors of
machine learning-based products and platforms. Some findings
are likely to be specific to the Microsoft teams and team
members who participated in our interviews and surveys. Nevertheless, given the high variety of projects represented by our
informants, we expect that many of the lessons we present in
this paper will apply to other companies. Some of our findings
depend on the particular ML workflow used by some software
teams at Microsoft. The reader should be able to identify how
our model abstractions fit into the particulars of the models
they use. Finally, interviews and surveys rely on self-selected
informants and self-reported data. Wherever appropriate, we
stated that findings were our informantsâ€™ perceptions and
opinions. This is especially true with this implementation
of our ML process maturity model, which triangulated its
measures against other equally subjective measures with no
objective baseline. Future implementations of the maturity
model should endeavor to gather objective measures of team
process performance and evolution.
